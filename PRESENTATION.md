PRESENTATION.md : Create your presentation/lesson "slides". This should include all of the info from your presentation. You SHOULD NOT just read the slides, but the slides should contain enough information such that if you didn't watch the video, you would learn most of it.






Rules:

Stack Manipulation				
Push a number onto stack	[SPACE]	[SPACE]	[NUMBER]	
Duplicate top item on stack	[SPACE]	[LINEFEED]	[SPACE]	
Swap the top 2 items on stack	[SPACE]	[LINEFEED]	[TAB]	
Discard top item on stack	[SPACE]	[LINEFEED]	[LINEFEED]	
Copy nth item on the stack onto top of stack	[SPACE]	[SPACE]	[NUMBER]	
Slide n items off the stack, keeping top item	[SPACE]	[LINEFEED]	[NUMBER]	
				
MATH	1st value popped [operation] 2nd value popped			
Addition	[TAB]	[SPACE]	[SPACE]	[SPACE]
Subtraction	[TAB]	[SPACE]	[SPACE]	[TAB]
Multiplication	[TAB]	[SPACE]	[SPACE]	[LINEFEED]
(Integer) Division	[TAB]	[SPACE]	[TAB]	[SPACE]
Modulo	[TAB]	[SPACE]	[TAB]	[TAB]
				
Heap Access				
Store in heap	[TAB]	[TAB]	[SPACE]	
Retrieve from heap	[TAB]	[TAB]	[TAB]	
				
Input/Output				
Pop heap address from stack, read character as ASCII, store character to the heap address	[TAB]	[LINEFEED]	[TAB]	[SPACE]
Pop heap address from stack, read number as ASCII, store number to the heap address	[TAB]	[LINEFEED]	[TAB]	[TAB]
Pop number from stack, output as an ASCII char	[TAB]	[LINEFEED]	[SPACE]	[SPACE]
Pop number from stack, output number 	[TAB]	[LINEFEED]	[SPACE]	[TAB]
				
Flow control (regulate data flow to prevent overwhelming the receiver)				
Mark a location in program	[LINEFEED]	[SPACE]	[SPACE]	[LABEL] ????
Call a subroutine	[LINEFEED]	[SPACE]	[TAB]	[LABEL] ????
Jump unconditionally to a label	[LINEFEED]	[SPACE]	[LINEFEED]	[LABEL] ????
Jump to a label if the top of the stack is zero	[LINEFEED]	[TAB]	[SPACE]	[LABEL] ????
Jump to label if the top of the stack is negative	[LINEFEED]	[TAB]	[TAB]	[LABEL] ????
End subroutine & transfer control back to caller  	[LINEFEED]	[TAB]	[LINEFEED]	
End program	[LINEFEED]	[LINEFEED]	[LINEFEED]
