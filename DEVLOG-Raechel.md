### 2025-05-15 - Setting up C files
I spent 35 minutes in class setting up whitespace.c and whitespace.h,
which will serve as the basis of our Whitespace interpreter. I set up
a function to parse args to run a command with execvp and began a
function that will read the file containing Whitespace text. The .h
file includes all required libraries and new functions.
