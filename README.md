# Whitespace Language Interpreter
 
### GROUP NAME: "[    ]"

Raechel Calungsod, Stacey Chen, Sophie Liu
       
### Project Description:
This project is a Whitespace interpreter. Whitespace, an esoteric programming language written 
by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris in 2002. Whitespace only takes in spaces, tabs, and new lines
that can be translated back into plaintext using a set algorithm. Our Whitespace interpreter
can do two things: take in a file containing Whitespace and print out what it spells in ASCII, or take in a file containing Whitespace and run the command that it is calling in ASCII. The function of the
interpreter depends on the flag used along with it.
